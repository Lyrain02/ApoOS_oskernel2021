# ApoOS_oskernel2021
Our ApoOS is a RISCV OS based on xv6-k210 and it's for the 2021 oskernel competition.
This is a teamwork involving 3 members, Yifan Li, Shan Huang, and me. We passed the preliminary round smoothly, but then gave up in the final stage due to some reasons.
This is not a complete project, but it's our first trying in this area.
I still want to record it here so that I can revisit it in the future to witness my growth. ^_^


It's mainly based on HUST-OS,
